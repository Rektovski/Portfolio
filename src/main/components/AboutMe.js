                Hello, human. I'm master student of Engineering Physics at GTU and Junior Front-End Developer.
                Started to learn programming at Softgen LLC. At this moment I have 1 year of experience into
                the technologies that is written in the "Software Knowledge" section. For the future, I want to
                learn deeper and deeper to become full-stack developer. I like to work with team or solo.
                Maybe, we'll be the best partners?
            </p>
