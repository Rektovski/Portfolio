                I’m master student of engineering physics Georgian Technical University, faculty of
                informatics and control systems, since 2017. Started to learn programing in 2021 oct, in Softgen on
                Full-Stack Dev course. First, they taught me C++ on the competitive tasks, then Html/Js/Css, after that
                we got information about Bootstrap, React, Reactjs, React-Bootstrap and little more about Api too. For
                working place in frontend I’m using Jetbrain’s „Webstorm“. At this time, I’ve to learn there more 2-
                3 month for Java, SQL, PostgreSQl, SpringBoot and so on to get the first steps as Full-Stack Junior
                Software Engineer. When I finished learning C++, I soon took on several students. I would love to teach
                a lot more, because teaching is my job, and my teaching experience came from working as a physics
                teacher in intensive training centers for entrants.
